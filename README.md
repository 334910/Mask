## Screenshot

![The screenshot displays the web page using the Gemini Pro model. The image being analyzed shows a suspension bridge over the Suối Mường Hoa river in northwestern Vietnam, taken before a reservoir was built. The scene features rice terraces in the background and a stone and wooden fence in the foreground. The interface includes: - Controls for selecting the Gemini model - Prompt input - JSON output - A preview showing the original image with segmentation boxes overlaid - A list of identified segments, with the bounded box input, monochrome mask, and a masked output displayed against a checkered background to highlight the isolated segment](docs/screenshot.png "Screenshot")
